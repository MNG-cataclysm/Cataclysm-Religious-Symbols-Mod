You preached sermons to your congregation, organized charitable activities, church events and meeting with members of the congregation to help them strengthen their faith and overcome significant life changes.  The Cataclysm hit you like an asteroid from the skies, however, your faith remains untouchable, but it is better for you to find something more tangible for your self-defense.",

In the cataclysm, you did everything you could to protect anyone that would come at the doors of the Church, and awaited for instructions from the Holy See, but it appears that prayers were not enough.  Now that they are all dead and there is no news from the Holy See, you should probably move on, for the sake of your survival.",
